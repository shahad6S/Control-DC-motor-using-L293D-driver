considering this circuit we have a current consumption of due to these components

Arduino ~ 50mA
Two motors ~40mA
ultrasonic sensor ~15mA (keeping in mind it is not added yet to this task, in particular, this circuit)
total current 105mA if we wanted to run the circuit for 24hr then, Total better supply (hr.mA)= time x total current in the circuit
total better supply = 24hr x 105mA = 2520 hr.mA
